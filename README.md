# SELF DRIVING BOT FOR GTA
The goal of this project is to make an intelligent bot that can drive a car or motorcycle in Grand Theft Auto 5. 

# MOTIVATION
This is a project for the machine learning course at Santa Clara University. Our group wanted to work on something that was challenging and involved interest from everyone in the group. Through this project we get to explore interacting with game through Python, using OpenCV, and deep learning techniques. The best possible way to see how well an AI drives a car would be through an open-world game which does not cause harm in real world.

# HOW TO USE IT
To see how the results of lane detection, navigate to folder lane-detection which contains multiple test images along with the algorithm to find lanes. A main.py is provided which on execution generates the results and stores it in the same directory with subfolder output. 

# TASK LIST
- [X] Grab screen images of the game 
- [X] Interact directly with the game via python
- [X] Detect street lanes for navigation
- [ ] Apply deep learning algorithms for self driving
